<h2>What features are offered by WhatsApp Plus?</h2>
WhatsApp Plus has a wide range of features, but the best one is video calling. Being able to do video
calls without having to pay any money and doing this free of charge is amazing. At the same time, the
app is also focused on the simpler stuff too. It allows you to increase the amount of letters that you have
in the status too. This makes it easier for you to express yourself. It’s a very simple thing to add, but in so
many updates, the regular version didn’t do it. But you do have it here.
  <br><br>
Aside from that, you can hide notifications. This is a good change of pace, because most of the time it
can be excruciating to deal with notifications. Hiding them in WhatsApp Plus is great, and it manages to
take the experience to some new heights thanks to that reason alone.<br><br>
Then you can also send larger video and audio files too. They don’t restrict you anymore like you are
restricted in the free version. The results are great here since you have no limitations and a much better
experience as a whole. It goes to show that the value and outcome are outstanding in the end and yes,
this really manages to pay off extremely well in the end. They also allow you to send ebooks or even set
passwords for chats. Yes, WhatsApp Plus is amazing to use, and it manages to remove those limits and
also improve on the features too.
